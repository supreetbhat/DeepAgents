"""M1.7 Homework: Design Your Own Multi-Thread Scenario.

THE IDEA
The lab used one topic (favorite colour) across two threads to show that
thread_a remembers it and thread_b doesn't. This homework asks you to
design your own multi-turn scenario and prove three things:
  1. that state persists within a thread across separate invoke() calls,
  2. that a different thread_id starts with no memory of it, and
  3. that this persistence lives in the MemorySaver instance rather than
     the thread_id string itself, by asking a brand-new agent with its
     own fresh MemorySaver the same question on thread_a's thread_id.

WHAT YOU FILL IN
  TODO 1: pick your own topic/fact for the agent to remember, and set up
    two or more of your own thread configs (different thread_ids).
  TODO 2: run the turns that demonstrate persistence (same thread
    remembers), isolation (a different thread doesn't), and checkpointer
    scope (a fresh MemorySaver on the same thread_id doesn't either).

RUN
  cd python
  uv run ./m1/m1.7_homework.py

# TODO 1: Pick your own topic and set up two or more thread configs.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Use a topic/fact of your own choosing (not favorite colour, the
#     lab's example).
#   - Define at least two thread configs with different thread_ids, e.g.
#     thread_a = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "my-thread-a"}}
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

thread_a = {"configurable":{"thread_id":"001"}}  # TODO 1: replace with your own thread config
thread_b = {"configurable":{"thread_id":"002"}}  # TODO 1: replace with your own thread config


# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# TODO 2: Run the turns that demonstrate persistence, isolation, and
# checkpointer scope.
#
# Requirements:
#   - In thread_a, send at least two turns: one that gives the agent your
#     fact, and a later one that asks it back. Print both responses.
#   - In thread_b (a different thread_id), ask the same follow-up
#     question with no prior context, and print the response. It should
#     NOT know the fact from thread_a.
#   - Build a SECOND agent with its own fresh MemorySaver(), and invoke it
#     on thread_a's thread_id, asking the same follow-up question. Print
#     the response and a line explaining why it doesn't know the fact
#     even though the thread_id matches: memory lives in the MemorySaver
#     instance, not in the thread_id string alone.
#
# Example shape for the second agent (delete this and write your own):
#   fresh_agent = create_deep_agent(model=model, checkpointer=MemorySaver())
#   result = fresh_agent.invoke(
#       {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]},
#       config=thread_a,
#   )
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
