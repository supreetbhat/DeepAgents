# Territory Report

A metrics task. The numbers come from the database; the chart is rendered
from them.

## 1. Gather the metrics

Ask **chinook-analyst** for Jane's book of business (`SupportRepId = 3`):

- Total revenue and number of invoices.
- Top customers by revenue (with amounts).
- Revenue by genre (for Jane's customers).
- Any obvious trend (e.g. revenue by year, if useful).

Get exact figures; do the arithmetic with the **code interpreter** if you need
to combine results.

## 2. Write the report

- Use the code interpreter to get today's date (Python: `import datetime; datetime.date.today().isoformat()`).
- `write_file` a clear Markdown report to `/outputs/territory_report-<date>.md`:
  headline totals, a top-customers list, and a revenue-by-genre table.

## 3. Chart

Call `render_pie_chart` with the revenue-by-genre labels and values, saved as
`territory_chart.png`. Reference the image in the report.

## Done

Tell Jane where the report and chart were saved, with the headline revenue
number.
