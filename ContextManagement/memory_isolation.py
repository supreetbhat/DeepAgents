"""M3.3 Homework: Prove Memory Isolation Between Users.

THE IDEA
The lab scoped memory to a single fixed workspace_id/user_id and only ever
ran the agent under that one context, so isolation between users was
described in the lesson's "Scoping memory" section but never actually shown
in code. This homework asks you to run the SAME agent under two different
contexts that share a workspace but belong to different users, seed each
with different facts, and confirm a detail you tell the agent to remember
under context A never leaks into what the agent says or stores under
context B.

WHAT YOU FILL IN
  TODO 1: write two DIFFERENT seed memories, one for CONTEXT_A and one for
    CONTEXT_B, in a domain of your choosing (not coding conventions). Both
    should be about the same general topic so a leak would be obvious if
    it happened, but with different specifics.
  TODO 2: write three prompts: a question answerable from A's seed alone, a
    "remember this" message that adds a new, distinctive fact under
    context A, and the SAME question asked again but under context B (it
    should get B's own answer, or no answer, never A's).

  cd python
